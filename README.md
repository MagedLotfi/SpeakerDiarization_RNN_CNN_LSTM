# SpeakerDiarization_RNN
Speaker diarization problem using Recurrent Neural Network. 
Speaker Diarization is the problem of separating speakers in an audio. There could be any number of speakers and final result should state when speaker starts and ends. In this project, we analyze given audio file with 2 channels and 2 speakers (on separate channel).
